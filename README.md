About Me
I’m Todd Wolf — an IT pro transitioning into cloud engineering, driven by workflow clarity and hands-on automation. I build tools that don’t just work — they self-heal, log their own progress, and speak in readable architecture. This portfolio reflects my obsession with modular design, shell fluency, and recovery-focused scripting across local, cloud, and remote contexts.

Thanks for visiting this repo. If it helps make Azure workflows more transparent, I’ve done my job.
