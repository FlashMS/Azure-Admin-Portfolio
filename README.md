# Azure-Admin-Portfolio

This portfolio is a modular, automation-ready toolkit designed for hybrid cloud administrators. It showcases resilient PowerShell scripting, session continuity workflows, and secure Azure deployment practices — all built with portability, recovery, and clarity in mind.

## Key Features

- Deployment automation via GitHub Actions and service principal authentication  
- Modular PowerShell tools for alias management, logging, and session restoration  
- Monitoring starter scripts for Log Analytics, Alerts, and Metrics  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) scaffolds for secure resource management  
- Infrastructure as Code samples for scalable provisioning

## Folder Structure


Each module is designed to be portable, discoverable, and automation-friendly. Scripts include comments and usage notes to support learning and reuse across environments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo to your local or cloud development environment  
2. Run `PowerShellToolkit/initProfile.ps1` to initialize session tools and aliases  
3. Customize your deployment workflow in `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`  
4. Reference `Monitoring/` and `RBAC/` for additional provisioning scripts

## About Me

I’m Todd Wolf — an IT pro transitioning into cloud engineering, driven by workflow clarity and hands-on automation. I build tools that don’t just work — they self-heal, log their own progress, and speak in readable architecture. This portfolio reflects my obsession with modular design, shell fluency, and recovery-focused scripting across local, cloud, and remote contexts.
